## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### Useful resources

- [bootstrap 4 cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) - This helped me for crating cards.
- [css ](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me in understanding using css to center and changing the background. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
